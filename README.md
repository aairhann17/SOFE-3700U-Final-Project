### Artwork Database System  
A Relational Model Inspired by The Metropolitan Museum of Art Open-Access Collection

#### Overview  
This project involves designing and implementing a structured relational database system for managing artwork information. The idea was inspired by the publicly available dataset from **The Metropolitan Museum of Art**, which offers a rich variety of artwork details suitable for building a meaningful database model.

The goal was to create an organized schema that clearly represents artworks, artists, cultural origins, and gallery locations, while maintaining strong data-management principles such as normalization and referential integrity. The database supports practical analysis by enabling users to run SQL queries, views, and sample operations that demonstrate real use cases.

#### Project Process  
The work began by examining the raw dataset and identifying logical entities. These were then separated into well-defined tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. After finalizing the schema, the database was implemented in **MySQL**, filled with sample data, and tested through various queries.

The completed system allows users to explore connections between different artworks, their creators, cultural origins, and the galleries where pieces are displayed.

#### Key Outcomes  
The final database design reflects the concepts learned throughout the course, including:

- Proper normalization  
- Strong referential integrity  
- Clear, well-structured schema development  
- Practical SQL analysis using queries and views  

This project report outlines the motivation behind the system, related background information, design decisions, implemented features, and final results. It also includes screenshots and example outputs from the functioning database.
